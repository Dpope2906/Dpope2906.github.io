<p>One day, Tamara Thompsen noticed a piece of wood peeking out of the sand of Wisconsin's Lake Mendota while conducting a scuba diving session this spring. Though many people would have dismissed it, Thomsen, a maritime archaeologist, had a strong suspicion that it was more than just drift wood.</p>

<h1>A year earlier…</h1>
<p>Thomsen had unearthed a 1,200-year-old canoe at the same lake in Madison about a year before. And her intuition was correct: the piece of wood poking out of the sand was, in fact, another dugout boat, estimated to be around 3,000 years old, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. Following the finding, Thomsen texted her supervisor, "Not a joke: I found another dugout canoe," according to Sophie Carson of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

<p>A 3,000-year-old canoe carved by the Ho-Chunk Nation around 1,000 B.C.E. is said to be the oldest canoe ever discovered in the Great Lakes region and the earliest direct evidence of water transportation utilized by Indigenous peoples in the region. The 14.5-foot-long canoe predates agriculture, pottery, and all of Wisconsin's effigy mounds. The discovery of the second boat in the same region opens up tremendous research and educational possibilities to investigate the technological, cultural, and stylistic developments in dugout canoe design over the last 3,000 years. </p>

<h1>Whats Next?</h1>
<p>The Wisconsin Historical Society intends to collaborate with Ho-Chunk Nation members in the quest for further boats and other relics from potential submerged villages. Citizens of the Ho-Chunk Nation and the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, as well as archaeologists and volunteers, dug the canoe by hand. The canoe was then brought to a state preservation facility in Madison, where it was meticulously cleaned before being put into a massive preservation vat that recently housed the 1,200-year-old canoe discovered in 2021. The boats will be preserved for the next two years by experts, who will freeze-dry them to remove any lingering lake water. The boats will be displayed prominently in Madison's new 100,000-square-foot history museum, which is set to open in 2026.</p>
